    <h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is working with computer hardware and building computers. I especially enjoy building gaming computers since gaming computers are more known for cool interior designs. A majority of my friends computers were built or upgraded by me and I have also built some computers for people in my family. The image shown below is of the gaming computer that I built for my wife. She has been getting into gaming lately and although she doesn't have much experience, we enjoy getting to game together.</p>

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>Another one of my hobbies is gaming. I enjoy a variety of games such as FPS games, TPS games, and MOBAs. Lately I have been into League of Legends, Rainbow Six Siege, and Spider-Man: Remastered. I primarily play PC games but I ocassionally enjoy kicking back on the couch and playing some Xbox.</p>
    
    <h2>Kickboxing</h2>
    <p>A more recent hobby of mine has been kickboxing. My wife and I joined a kickboxing gym recently and have been going almost every day. It's a great way to work out and it's a healthy way to get some aggression out if I am having a bad day.</p>
